# repository for stuff...
## about me
i've learned (and forgot / want to re-learn) quite a lot during my studies at the University of Rostock. 
this repository has been put effort into since 2025-11-13 and i'll be trying my best to develop some summaries of anything related to information technology (Informationstechnik / Technische Informatik)
and more general coding and mathematics related stuff. i started studying in 2021 and am expecting a call (literally) from a psychiatrist. 

Though i don't really feel like slacking off too much right now,
my friend(s) and family, as well as my local doctor, have deemed it'd be best to
reevaluate my (apparent) current situation and re-consider my substance abuse issue,
before starting my third attempt at writing a thesis.

That's more than enough stuff about me. Imagine me in any way you'd like, 
but please consider me as someone who is... at a loss for words when describing how 
scary the thought about my past few months can be and... scared he could potentially become delirious.

## about the structure
it might be best to just keep this a close copy of my local files and 
keep my own commentary as little as possible (and thus the documentation as precise/concise as needed).

## structure
|folder/file|contains/contents|
|---|---|
|thesis|my bachelors thesis (and hopefully not final)|
|maths|digital logic, linear algebra, stochastics, analysis|
|physics|some basic mechanics (repo started with this)|

## extra commentary
the hidden mutual agreement in anything related to computer science is that we're all to afraid to read a book and have thus tried to find ways for machines to handle this task for us.
somehow writing this produces a will inside of me to read. life after school is weird. but again the thought of going to school is nicer, than actually doing so (this is not a statement against my teachers or peers, but a way to cope by trying to sound as robotic as possible while being an utter emotional mess).
